2026-01-27T11:00:37 [CRITICAL]	2026-01-27T11:00:37.533Z		Critical security dependency missing: cannot import name 'require_authentication' from 'src.common.auth_utils' (/var/task/src/common/auth_utils.py)
2026-01-27T11:00:37 [WARNING]	2026-01-27T11:00:37.537Z		LAMBDA_WARNING: Unhandled exception. The most likely cause is an issue in the function code. However, in rare cases, a Lambda runtime update can cause unexpected function behavior. For functions using managed runtimes, runtime updates can be triggered by a function change, or can be applied automatically. To determine if the runtime has been updated, check the runtime version in the INIT_START log entry. If this error correlates with a change in the runtime version, you may be able to mitigate this error by temporarily rolling back to the previous runtime version. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html
